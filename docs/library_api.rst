Library API
===========

The Triton Inference Server provides a backwards-compatible C API that
allows Triton to be linked directly into a C/C++ application. The API
is documented in `tritonserver.h
<https://github.com/triton-inference-server/core/blob/main/include/triton/core/tritonserver.h>`_.

A simple example of the library API can be found at
`src/servers/simple.cc
<https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/src/servers/simple.cc>`_. A
more complicated example can be found in the files that make up the
inference server executable, *tritonserver*. The tritonserver
executable implements the HTTP/REST and GRPC endpoints and uses the
library API to communicate with the core of Triton. The primary files
composing *tritonserver* are `src/servers/main.cc
<https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/src/servers/main.cc>`_,
`src/servers/grpc_server.cc
<https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/src/servers/grpc_server.cc>`_,
and `src/servers/http_server.cc
<https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/src/servers/http_server.cc>`_.
